		Sometimes, when I click too fast on one place, I get a message saying that the next tile is occupied. 
		I think this happens because the unit is in one place, I send a request for another path, and before the
		path is calculated, the unit moves. The first tile on the newly calculated path is the one that the unit
		is standing on right now. That's why it says it cannot move because the next tile is occupied.

		This is also the reason why when I send a new path request that's opposite of the path the unit is taking
		right now, it sometimes "jumps" a few tiles.

		Temporary (?) solution: When I select a new path, the unit will stop moving.
